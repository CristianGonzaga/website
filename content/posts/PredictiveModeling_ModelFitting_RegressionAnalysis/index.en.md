## About the Course

The *Predictive Modeling, Model Fitting, and Regression Analysis* course offered by **University 
of California, Irvine** and taught by **Julie Pai** explores different approaches in predictive 
modeling, and discusses how a model can be either supervised or unsupervised. Review how a 
model can be fitted, trained and scored to apply to both historical and future data in an 
effort to address business objectives. Finally, this course includes a hands-on activity to 
develop a linear regression model.

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of four weeks.

### Week 1
* **Predictive Modeling**

This module begins with a comparison of predictive and descriptive analytics, and discusses what 
can be learned from both. Discussion of supervised and unsupervised modeling, two foundational 
models in analytics and machine learning.

### Week 2
* **Data Dimensionality and Classification Analysis**

Exploration of how data can be classified and how decision trees can be leveraged as a fast, 
easy to use a model that is easy to interpret, explain, and visualize.

### Week 3
* **Model Fitting**

Exploration of the concept of model fitting and how creating a generalized model that is able to 
fit both historical and future data is the ultimate goal. Review how a model can be trained or 
scored to apply to new and unlabeled data.

### Week 4
* **Regression Analysis**

Explanation of regression analytics, a popular technique used by data science professionals to 
make predictions. Discussion of how achieving model fit is not a guarantee that a model can help 
solve a business problem, and how even a good model can sometimes lead to unactionable outcomes.
