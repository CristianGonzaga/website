## About the Course

The *Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python* course offered by **University 
of Michigan** and taught by **Christopher Brooks** introduces the learner to information 
visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. 
The course starts with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes 
a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of 
visualizations. The second week focus on the technology used to make visualizations in python, 
matplotlib, and introduce users to best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize 
design decisions in the framework. The third week is a tutorial of functionality available in 
matplotlib, and demonstrate a variety of basic statistical charts helping learners to identify when 
a particular method is good for a particular problem. The course ends with a discussion of other

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of four weeks.

### Week 1
* **Module 1: Principles of Information Visualization**

Introduction to principles of information visualization. Introduction to tools for thinking about 
design and graphical heuristics for thinking about creating effective visualizations. All of the 
course information on grading, prerequisites, and expectations are on the course syllabus, 
which is included in this module.

### Week 2
* **Module 2: Basic Charting**

You delve into basic charting. For this week’s assignment, you work with real world CSV weather 
data. You manipulate the data to display the minimum and maximum temperature for a range of dates 
and demonstrate that you know how to create a line graph using matplotlib. Additionally, you 
demonstrate the procedure of composite charts, by overlaying a scatter plot of record breaking 
data for a given year.

### Week 3
* **Module 3: Charting Fundamentals**

Exploration of charting fundamentals. For this week’s assignment you implement a new visualization 
technique based on academic research. This assignment is flexible and you can address it 
using a variety of difficulties - from an easy static image to an interactive chart where users 
can set ranges of values to be used.

### Week 4
* **Module 4: Applied Visualizations**

In this module, then everything starts to come together. Your final assignment is entitled “Becoming 
a Data Scientist.” This assignment requires that you identify at least two publicly accessible 
datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension. You state a 
research question that can be answered using these data sets and then create a visual using 
matplotlib that addresses your stated research question. You will then be asked to justify how 
your visual addresses your research question.
