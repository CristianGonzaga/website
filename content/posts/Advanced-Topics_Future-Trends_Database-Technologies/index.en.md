## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of four weeks.

### Week 1
* **DBMS Administration Essentials**

They take a deeper look into the internals of DBMS software to better understand how it works. 
Examine the role of the DBA (Database Administrator), the Data Scientist, the Data Architect, 
and other career paths in the realm of database technologies. Finally, cover DBMS essentials 
such as concurrency management, backup & recovery, and transaction logging.

### Week 2
* **Data Warehousing, Data Cube**
Different perspective of organizing the data, Data Warehouse, or Online Analytical Processing. 

### Week 3
* **Big Data and the Data Explosion**

They said we are in the era of data explosion. While relational databases are still widely used, 
we are having new problems to deal with data that is different than the one we have been organizing. 
This new type of data, with 10 V's in the definition, is called Big Data. Therefore, the definitions, 
challenges and architecture of Big Data are explored.

### Week 4
* **The Relational Problem and NoSQL Systems**

Although relational database software has been in use for decades, relational database systems 
still command a huge share of the database software marketplace. However, with the more recent 
explosion of Big Data, it has opened the door for non-relational database solutions ("NoSQL") 
to capture marketshare from relational systems. In this module they take a deeper look into 
the most popular NoSQL database technologies.
