## Program

The specialized program consists of a set of four courses.

### Course 1
* **Intro to Analytic Thinking, Data Science, and Data Mining**

The *Intro to Analytic Thinking, Data Science, and Data Mining* course begins with an exploration of the field and profession of data science 
with a focus on the skills and ethical considerations required when working with data. Reviews 
the types of business problems data science can solve and discusses the application of the 
CRISP-DM process to data mining efforts. A brief overview of Descriptive, Predictive, and 
Prescriptive Analytics are provided, and the course concludes with an exploratory activity to 
learn more about the tools and resources you might find in a data science toolkit.

### Course 2
* **Predictive Modeling, Model Fitting, and Regression Analysis**

The *Predictive Modeling, Model Fitting, and Regression Analysis* course explores different approaches in predictive 
modeling, and discusses how a model can be either supervised or unsupervised. Review how a 
model can be fitted, trained and scored to apply to both historical and future data in an 
effort to address business objectives. Finally, this course includes a hands-on activity to 
develop a linear regression model.

### Course 3
* **Cluster Analysis, Association Mining, and Model Evaluation**

The *Cluster Analysis, Association Mining, and Model Evaluation* course offered by **University of 
California, Irvine** and taught by **Julie Pai** begins with an exploration of cluster analysis 
and segmentation, and discusses how techniques such as collaborative filtering and association 
rules mining can be applied. Explanation of how a model can be evaluated for performance, and 
review the differences in analysis types and when to apply them.

### Course 4
* **Natural Language Processing and Capstone Assignment**

The *Natural Language Processing and Capstone Assignment* course recognizes how technical and business techniques 
can be used to deliver business insight, competitive intelligence, and consumer sentiment.
