## About the Course

The *Foundations of Sports Analytics: Data, Representation, and Models in Sports* course offered by 
**University of Michigan** and taught by **Wenche Wang** & **Stefan Szymanski** provides an 
introduction to using Python to analyze team performance in sports. Learners will discover a 
variety of techniques that can be used to represent sports data and how to extract narratives 
based on these analytical techniques. The main focus of the introduction will be on the use of 
regression analysis to analyze team and player performance data, using examples drawn from the 
National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey 
League (NHL), the English Premier League (EPL, soccer) and the Indian Premier League (IPL, cricket). 

This course does not simply explain methods and techniques, it enables the learner to apply them 
to sports datasets of interest so that they can generate their own results, rather than relying 
on the data processing performed by others.  As a consequence the learning will be empowered to 
explore their own ideas about sports team performance, test them out using the data, and so 
become a producer of sports analytics rather than a consumer.

While the course materials have been developed using Python, code has also been produced to 
derive all of the results in R, for those who prefer that environment.

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of six weeks.

### Week 1
* **Introduction to Sports Performance and Data**

Introduction of a simple example of sports analytics in practice - the calculation of the 
Pythagorean expectation to model winning in team sports. This can also be used for the 
purposes of prediction. Examples are developed for five different sports leagues, Major 
League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey 
League (NHL), the English Premier League (EPL-soccer) and the Indian Premier League (IPL-cricket).

### Week 2
* **Introduction to Data Sources**

This week uses NBA data to introduce basic and important Python codes to conduct data cleaning 
and data preparation. This week also discusses summary and descriptive analyses with statistics 
and graphs to understand the distribution of data, the characteristics and pattern of variables 
as well as the relationship between two variables. At the end of this week, introduction of 
correlation coefficients to summarize the linear relationship between two variables.

### Week 3
* **Introduction to Sports Data and Plots in Python**

Introduction of some ways of representing data using examples from MLB, the NBA and Indian 
Premier League. MLB data is used to analyze the spatial distribution of different hits. NBA 
data is used to generate heatmaps to illustrate the different ways in which players contribute. 
IPL data is used to show how team performances can be compared graphically.

### Week 4
* **Introduction to Sports Data and Regression Using Python**

Introduction of the fundamentals of regression analysis. Discussion of how to perform regression 
analysis using Python and how to interpret regression output. Use NHL data to estimate multiple 
regression models to identify the team level performance factors that affect the team's winning 
percentage. Use cricket data from the Indian Premier League to run regression analyses to 
examine whether player performance impacts player salary.

### Week 5
* **More on Regressions**

This module uses regression analysis to investigate the relationship between team salary spending 
and team performance in the NBA, NHL, EPL and IPL. The module explores different ways of defining 
the regression model, and how to interpret competing regression model results.

### Week 6
* **Is There a Hot Hand in Basketball?**

This week studies an interesting topic in sport, the hot hand. Introduction of the concept of 
hot hand and discuss the academic research that examines whether the hot hand is a phenomenon or 
a fallacy. Demonstration of how to analytically test the hot hand using the NBA shot log data. 
Test whether NBA players have hot hand by computing conditional probabilities and autocorrelation 
coefficients as well as performing regression analyses.
