## About the Course

The *Cluster Analysis, Association Mining, and Model Evaluation* course offered by **University of 
California, Irvine** and taught by **Julie Pai** begins with an exploration of cluster analysis 
and segmentation, and discusses how techniques such as collaborative filtering and association 
rules mining can be applied. Explanation of how a model can be evaluated for performance, and 
review the differences in analysis types and when to apply them.

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of four weeks.

### Week 1
* **Cluster Analysis and Segmentation**

Exploration of cluster analysis, a popular unsupervised learning algorithm. Review the two 
major styles of cluster analysis, and discussion of potential applications to different industries.

### Week 2
* **Collaborative Filtering, Association Rules Mining (Market Basked Analysis)**

Explanation of collaborative filtering and association rules mining, and how these techniques are 
used to make automatic predictions. It takes a closer look at the various common applications of 
market basket analysis.

### Week 3
* **Classification-Type Prediction Models**

Explanation of how classification-type prediction models are evaluated for performance, and how a 
confusion matrix can help visualize that performance. Discussion of the applicability of cluster 
analysis, and how it can be used to detect rare events such as fraudulent transactions.

### Week 4
* **Regression-Type Prediction Models**

Review how regression analytics are used for both hypothesis testing and prediction, and how a 
scatter plot can be leveraged to better understand the relationship between two variables. 
Discussion of the differences between correlation analysis and a regression analysis, and a look at 
simple vs multiple regression.
