## About the Course

The course *Managing Machine Learning Projects* offered by **Duke University** and 
taught by **Jon Reifschneider** provides ecourse on the key steps of an ML project, 
from how to identify good opportunities for ML to data collection, model creation, 
deployment, and monitoring and maintenance of production systems.

In addition, it focuses on developing the corresponding skills to: 
1. Identify opportunities to apply ML to solve problems for users
2. Apply the data science process to organize ML projects
3. Evaluate the key technology decisions to make in ML system design
4. Lead ML projects from ideation through production using best practice

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of five weeks.

### Week 1
* **Identifying Opportunities for Machine Learning**

Discuss how to identify problems worth solving, how to determine whether ML is a good 
fit as part of the solution, and how to validate solution concepts. Learn why heuristics 
are useful in modeling projects and the advantages and disadvantages of ML relative to 
heuristics.

### Week 2
* **Organizing ML Projects**

Focus on the CRISP-DM data science process and how it can be used to organize ML projects. 
Begin by understanding what is unique about ML project relative to normal software projects, 
and then discuss approaches to manage the inherent risks of ML projects. Also walk through 
the key roles on a ML project team and how to organize work.

### Week 3
* **Data Considerations**

Explore the key data-related issues that arise in ML projects. Data is the foundation of 
successful machine learning, and gathering data of sufficient quantity and quality with 
the right set of attributes is the key to a successful project. Discuss the key 
considerations in sourcing data, cleaning data, and developing and selecting a 
feature set to use in modeling. Conclude with a discussion on best practices to ensure 
reproducibility of your data pipeline.

### Week 4
* **ML System Design & Technology Selection**

Discuss the key decisions to make in designing ML systems, such as cloud vs. edge 
and online vs. batch, and compare the benefits of each type of system. Then discuss 
the primary technology decisions to make in a ML project and introduce the common 
tools and technologies used to build ML models.

### Week 5
* **Model Lifecycle Management**

Focus on identifying and mitigating the key issues which ML models experience once 
they are in production. Discuss how to set up a robust ML system monitoring capability 
and define a model maintenance plan to maintain high performance of a production model. 
Conclude with a discussion on the importance of versioning in ML systems to facilitate 
continued rapid iteration even after deployment.
