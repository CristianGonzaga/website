## About

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an educational backlog throughout Mexico. It is estimated 
that children will fall behind in school by up to two grades, while more than 5 million 
infants will drop out of school system. Therefore, the project *Math Tutoring to 
Defend Education* seeks to provide quality education through online mathematics tutoring 
to primary and secondary school children.

In this project, weekly math tutorials had to be given to children from public schools 
in different parts of the country. Among the activities carried out were:

1. Take trainings to provide online tutoring.
2. Follow-up of students (by Whatsapp) according to their assigned group.
3. Development of follow-up activities (reports).
4. Development of additional activities (information sessions, integration activities, among others).
5. Class planning.
6. Weekly tutorials, corresponding to the group.

In addition, among the topics taught are: a) Demonstration of the law of signs, b) addition 
of numbers with different signs, c) numerical sets, d) operations between fractions, 
e) exponentiation, f) neutral element for multiplication, g) equivalent fractions, h) 
divisibility criteria, i) prime numbers, j) fundamental theorem of arithmetic, k) multiples 
of a number and l) least common multiple.

Finally, were promoted the values and attitudes of citizen participation, cooperative problem 
solving and the coordination of collective actions to improve the quality of life of society, 
as well as fostering a culture of legality, human rights and/or the strengthening of democracy.
