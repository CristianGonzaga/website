## About the Course

The *Prediction Models with Sports Data* course offered by **University of Michigan** and taught by 
**Youngho Park** & **Stefan Szymanski** generates forecasts of game results in professional 
sports using Python. The main emphasis of the course is on teaching the method of logistic 
regression as a way of modeling game results, using data on team expenditures. The learner is

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of five weeks.

### Week 1

This module introduces the regression models in dealing with the categorical outcome variables 
in sport contest (i.e., Win, Draw, Lose). It explains the Linear Probability Model (LPM) in terms 
of its theoretical foundations, computational applications, and empirical limitations. 
Then the module introduces and demonstrates the Logistic Regression as a better substitute of 
LPM for the categorical dependent variables.

### Week 2

This module explores the relationship between probability and betting markets. It explains the 
concept of odds, and the relationship between betting odds and probabilities. It then develops 
a measure of the accuracy of betting odds using sports examples, and assesses the meaning of 
efficiency in betting markets.

### Week 3

This module shows how to forecast the outcome of EPL soccer games using an ordered logit model 
and publicly available information. It assesses the accuracy of these forecasts against the 
betting odds and shows that they are remarkably accurate.

### Week 4

This module assesses the efficacy of the EPL forecasting model covered in the previous week by 
replicating the model in the context of three North American team sports leagues (i.e., NHL, 
NBA, MLB). Specifically, this module shows how to forecast the outcome of NHL, NBA, MLB regular 
season games using an ordered logit model and publicly available information. It assesses the 
accuracy of these forecasts against the betting odds.

### Week 5

Historical and social consequences of gambling, and the relationship between gambling and 
statistics. Gambling is explored from the perspective of different ethical and religious systems. 
Issues of problem gambling are explored and assessed.
