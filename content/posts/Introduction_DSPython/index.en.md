## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of four weeks.

### Week 1
* **Fundamentals of Data Manipulation with Python**

Introduction to the field of data science, review common Python functionality and features which 
data scientists use, and be introduced to the Coursera Jupyter Notebook for the lectures. All of 
the course information on grading, prerequisites, and expectations are on the course syllabus, 
and you can find more information about the Jupyter Notebooks on the Course Resources page.

### Week 2
* **Basic Data Processing with Pandas**

Learn the fundamentals of one of the most important toolkits Python has for data cleaning and 
processing -- pandas. Read in data into DataFrame structures, how to query these structures, 
and the details about such structures are indexed.

### Week 3
* **More Data Processing with Pandas**

Deep your understanding of the python pandas library by learning how to merge DataFrames, 
generate summary tables, group data into logical pieces, and manipulate dates. Refresh your 
understanding of scales of data, and discuss issues with creating metrics for analysis. The week 
ends with a more significant programming assignment.

### Week 4
* **Answering Questions with Messy Data**

Introduction to a variety of statistical techniques such a distributions, sampling and t-tests. 
The week ends with two discussions of science and the rise of the fourth paradigm -- data driven 
discovery.
