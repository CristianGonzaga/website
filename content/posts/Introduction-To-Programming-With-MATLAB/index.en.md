## About the course

Teaches computer programming to those with little to no previous experience. 
It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB. MATLAB is a special-purpose 
language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems 
involving the manipulation of numbers, being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural 
sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily 
used in industry.

It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general 
concepts in computer science and programming.

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of nine weeks.

### Week 1

* **Course Pages**

### Week 2

* **The MATLAB Environment**

Learn how to start MATLAB and will familiarize ourselves with its user interface. 
Learn how to use MATLAB as a sophisticated calculator. 
Learn about syntax and semantics. 
See ways in which MATLAB provides help. 
Finally, learn how to create plots in MATLAB.

### Week 3

* **Matrices and Operators**

Learn how to define matrices, extract parts of them and combine them to form new matrices. 
Learn how to use operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide matrices, and 
learn that there are several different types of multiplication and division. 
Finally, learn MATLAB’s rules for determining the order in which operators are carried out when more 
than one of them appear in the same expression.

### Week 4

* **Functions**

Functions let us break up complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. 
Learn how functions let us create reusable software components that can be applied in many different programs. 
Learn how the environment inside a function is separated from the outside via a well 
defined interface through which it communicates with that outside world. 
Learn how to define a function to allow input to it when it initiates its execution and output from it when it is done.


### Week 5

* **Programmer's Toolbox**

Learn about polymorphism and how MATLAB exploits it to change a function's behavior on the basis 
of the number and type of its inputs. Learn how to use the MATLAB random number generator. 
Learn how to get input from the keyboard, how to print to the Command Window, and how to plot graphs in a Figure window. 
Finally, learn how to find programming errors with the help of the debugger.

### Week 6

* **Selection**

Learn how to use the if-statement, which is the most important method of selection. 
Learn how to use relational operators and logical operators. 
Learn how to write polymorphic functions and how to make functions resistant to error.

### Week 7

* **Loops**

Learn how to use both of MATLAB's loop constructs: the for-loop and the while-loop. 
Learn how the break-statement works, and use nested loops. 
Learn how to make loops more efficient. 
Learn about logical indexing and how to use it to produce implicit loops that 
are efficient and easy for a user to understand.

### Week 8

* **Data Types**

Learn that there are ten types of numbers and that there are conversion functions to change one type into another. 
Learn much more about strings and how the characters in them are encoded as numbers. 
Learn how to produce heterogeneous collections of data via structs and cells, and 
learn how to store points in time and time durations.

### Week 9

* **File Input/Output**

Be introduced to MATLAB’s most important methods for reading and writing files. 
Learn how to create, read from, and write into MAT-files, Excel files, text files, and binary files. 
Learn how to navigate among folders with MATLAB commands.
