## About

The project found the relationship between meteorological factors and pollution. The data 
used was provided by the Atmospheric Monitoring System of the Metropolitan Zone of 
Mexico City. From these, R software was chosen to clean and sort them and 
subsequently generate linear and multiple regression.

It is important to mention that R is a programming language specialized in statistical 
analysis. This is mentioned because R provided a wide variety of useful tools for 
data processing and analysis. For the above, libraries specialized in data handling 
and graphing were used, such as: *tidyverse*, *dplyr*, *gapminder* and *GGally*. Additionally, 
a local web application was generated in which the user can choose both the station 
and the time period to be visualized, using the *shiny* and *shinydashboard* libraries. In 
addition, through the application, R presents both linear and multiple regression plots 
along with statistical information depending on the user's configuration. Therefore, it 
is useful for users, being an efficient way to analyze the results under different 
circumstances. 

Developing a mathematical model that estimates the concentration of sulfur dioxide 
particles based on atmospheric pressure (mmHG), temperature (degrees Celsius), relative 
humidity (percentage), wind direction (degrees) and wind speed (meters per second).
