## About the Course

The *Introduction to Machine Learning in Sports Analytics* course offered by **University of 
Michigan** and taught by **Christopher Brooks** explores supervised machine learning techniques 
using the python scikit learn (sklearn) toolkit and real-world athletic data to understand 
both machine learning algorithms and how to predict athletic outcomes. Building on the previous 
courses in the specialization, students will apply methods such as support vector machines 
(SVM), decision trees, random forest, linear and logistic regression, and ensembles of learners 
to examine data from professional sports leagues such as the NHL and MLB as well as 
wearable devices such as the Apple Watch and inertial measurement units (IMUs). By the end 
of the course students have a broad understanding of how classification and regression techniques 
can be used to enable sports analytics across athletic activities and events.

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of four weeks.

### Week 1
* **Machine Learning Concepts**

Introduction of the concept of machine learning and describe the four major areas of places it 
can be used in sports analytics. The machine learning pipeline is discussed, as well as some 
common issues one runs into when using machine learning for sports analytics.

### Week 2
* **Support Vector Machines**

In this week students will learn how Support Vector Machines (SVM) work, and will experience these 
models when looking at both baseball and wearable data. Coming out of the week students have 
experience building SVMs with real data and will be able to apply them to problems of their own.

### Week 3
* **Decision Trees**

Focus on interpretable methods for machine learning with a particular focus on decision trees. 
Students learn how these models work in general, and see special uses of decision trees in 
combination with regression methods. In this week students will come to better understand how 
the python sklearn toolkit can be used for a breadth of supervised learning tasks.

### Week 4
* **Ensembles & Beyond**

Students will learn how many different models can be used together through ensembles, including 
the random forest method as a common use, as well as more general methods available in sklearn 
such as stacking and bagging. By the end of this week students will have a broad understanding 
of how methods such as SVMs, decision trees, and logistic regression can be used together to 
solve a problem with increasing performance.
