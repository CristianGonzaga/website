## About

In Mexico, there is a high dropout rate at the high school level. In order to prepare 
students to have a better job, the project *Comparte tu Conocimiento* of the H. Ayuntamiento 
de Atizapán de Zaragoza - Dirección de Educación seeks to provide counseling in different 
subjects of open high school to adults and young people of the municipality. 

Among the activities performed were:

1. Receiving training to provide counseling in accordance with the assigned subject matter.
2. Preparing the advisories according to the assigned subject (mathematics), coordinated 
by the Organization.
3. To provide counseling in different subjects (in my case, mathematics) of open high school 
to adults and young people of the municipality.
4. Receive feedback according to the results of the exams taken by the adults and young 
people to whom the counseling was given.

In addition, among the topics taught are: a) remarkable products, b) exponent rules, 
c) operations with fractions, d) fundamental theorem of arithmetic, e) least common 
multiple, f) inequalities and g) properties of real numbers.

Finally, the values of commitment and acting responsibly were promoted, to ensure the 
well-being of the community, through actions that guarantee access to human rights, 
empowerment of citizens and communities, as well as the care, maintenance and sustainable 
use of resources and common goods.
