## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of four weeks.

### Week 1
* **Getting Started with Python**

Learn how to set up an isolated Python environment with third party libraries and apply it by 
setting up a virtual environment including Pandas and Jupyter.

### Week 2
* **Essential Python**

Creation and use Python Sequences, Dictionaries, Sets, List Comprehensions, and Generators. 
Additionally, you will learn how to apply these by manipulating client data in a Jupyter notebook.

### Week 3
* **Data in Python: Pandas and Alternatives**

Learn how to load data into a Pandas DataFrame and write statements to select columns and rows 
from a DataFrame. Additionally, you will apply comparison and boolean operators as a method of 
selecting data.

### Week 4
* **Python Development Environments**

Learn the basics of some popular development environments and apply it by writing code in Vim 
and Visual Studio Code. Additionally, you will learn how to check your code into a Git repository.
