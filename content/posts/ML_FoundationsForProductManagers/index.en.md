## About the Course

The *Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers* course offered by **Duke University** 
and taught by **Jon Reifschneider** builds a foundational understanding of what machine learning 
is, how it works and when and why it is applied. This course provides a non-coding introduction to 
machine learning, with focus on the process of developing models, ML model evaluation and 
interpretation, and the intuition behind common ML and deep learning algorithms. 
The course concludes with a hands-on project in which you train and optimize a machine learning 
model on a simple real-world problem.

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of six weeks.

### Week 1
* **What is Machine Learning**

Introduction to what machine learning is and does. Builds the necessary vocabulary for working with 
data and models and develop an understanding of the different types of machine learning. 
Concludes with a critical discussion of what machine learning can do well and cannot (or should 
not) do.

### Week 2
* **The Modeling Process**

Discussion of the key steps in the process of building machine learning models. Learning about the 
sources of model complexity and how complexity impacts a model's performance. Wrap up with a 
discussion of strategies for comparing different models to select the optimal model for production.

### Week 3
* **Evaluating & Interpreting Models**

Learning about how to define appropriate outcome and output metrics for AI projects. Discussion of key 
metrics for evaluating regression and classification models and how to select one for use. Wrap 
up with a discussion of common sources of error in machine learning projects and how to 
troubleshoot poor performance.

### Week 4 
* **Linear Models**

Exploration of the use of linear models for regression and classification. Begins with introducing 
linear regression and continue with a discussion on how to make linear regression work better 
through regularization. Then switch to classification and introduce the logistic regression model 
for both binary and multi-class classification problems.

### Week 5
* **Trees, Ensemble Models and Clustering**

Discussion of tree models and their value in modeling compex non-linear problems. They then introduce 
the method of creating ensemble models and their benefits. Wrap this module up by switching gears 
to unsupervised learning and discussing clustering and the popular K-Means clustering approach.

### Week 6
* **Deep Learning & Course Project**

Focus on a hot area of machine learning called deep learning, or the use of multi-layer neural 
networks. Development of an understanding of the intuition and key mathematical principles 
behind how neural networks work. Discussion of common applications of deep learning in 
computer vision and natural language processing. Wrap up the course with a course 
project, where you have an opportunity to apply the modeling process and best practices 
you have learned to create your own machine learning model.
