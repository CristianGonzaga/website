## About the Course
The *Python Data Structures* course, offered by  **University of Michigan** and
taught by **Charles Russell Severance**, introduces the core data structures of 
the Python programming language. Move past the basics of procedural programming 
and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, 
dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis.

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of seven weeks.

### Week 1
* **Strings (chapter six)**

Covers Strings and moves into data structures.

### Week 2
* **Installing and Using Python**

Set things up to write Python programs.

### Week 3
* **Files (chapter seven)**

Develop programas to read, explore and process data by reading 
and writing files on the secondary storage on the computer.

### Week 4
* **Lists (chapter eight)**

Use lists to store many values in a single variable using an indexing 
scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a 
single variable.

### Week 5
* **Dictionaries (chapter nine)**

Use dictionaries to store data as key / value pairs. Using key / value pairs 
gives us a simple in-memory "database" in a single Python variable.

### Week 6
* **Tuples (chapter ten)**

Use tuples as a simple version of lists.

### Week 7
* **Graduation**

Online graduation ceremony to celebrate the halfway point 
in the Python for Everybody Specialization,
