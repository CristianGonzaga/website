## About the Course

The *Moneyball and Beyond* course offered by **University of Michigan** and taught by **Stefan 
Szymanski** shows how to program data using Python to test the claims that lie behind the 
Moneyball story, and to examine the evolution of Moneyball statistics since the book was 
published. The learner is led through the process of calculating baseball performance statistics 
from publicly available datasets. The course progresses from the analysis of on base percentage and 
slugging percentage to more advanced measures derived using the run expectancy matrix, such as wins

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of five weeks.

### Week 1

Introduction of the Moneyball story and exploration of the method used to test that story. 
The process replicates the moneyball test by establishing the relationship between team winning 
and two performance statistics - on base percentage (OBP) and slugging percentage (SLG).

### Week 2

Estimation of the relationship between MLB player salaries and their performance statistics, 
OBP (on base percentage) and SLG (slugging). The results appear to confirm the Moneyball story - 
OBP was undervalued relative to SLG prior to the publication of Moneyball, while after 
publication the relative significance is reversed.

### Week 3

It updates the analysis of Hakes & Sauer and estimates the rewards to OBP and SLG over the period 
1994 -2015. In addition it shows how rewards can be related to individual components of SLG: 
walks, singles, doubles, triples, and home runs.

### Week 4

Introduction of the concept of run expectancy, shows how to derive the run expectancy matrix and 
the calculation of run values based on an MLB dataset of all events in the 2018 season. Run 
values are calculated by event type (walks, singles, doubles, etc.) and by player.

### Week 5

This module examines the concept of Wins Above Replacement (WAR) and shows how to calculate WAR 
based on batting performance. The relationship between play run values team win percentage and 
player salaries is then explored. Run values are shown to have a high degree of correlation with 
winning and with salaries. Run values can to a limited extent predict win percentage.
