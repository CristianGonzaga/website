## About the Course

The *Sports Performance Analytics* course offered by *University of Michigan* and taught by 
**Wenche Wang**, **Youngho Park**, **Christopher Brooks**, **Stefan Szymanski** & **Peter F. 
Bodary** provides how to construct predictive models to anticipate team and player 
performance. Also replicates the success of Moneyball using real statistical models, uses the Linear 
Probability Model (LPM) to anticipate categorical outcomes variables in sports contests, explores 
how teams collect and organize an athlete’s performance data with wearable technologies, 
and how to apply machine learning in a sports analytics context.

## Program

The specialized program consists of a set of five courses.

### Course 1
* **Moneyball and Beyond**

The *Moneyball and Beyond* taught by **Stefan 
Szymanski** shows how to program data using Python to test the claims that lie behind the 
Moneyball story, and to examine the evolution of Moneyball statistics since the book was 
published. The learner is led through the process of calculating baseball performance statistics 
from publicly available datasets. The course progresses from the analysis of on base percentage and 
slugging percentage to more advanced measures derived using the run expectancy matrix, such as wins 
above replacement (WAR). By the end of this course the learner will be able to use these statistics 
to conduct their own team and  player analyses. 

### Course 2
* **Prediction Models with Sports Data**

The *Prediction Models with Sports Data* course taught by 
**Youngho Park** & **Stefan Szymanski** generates forecasts of game results in professional 
sports using Python. The main emphasis of the course is on teaching the method of logistic 
regression as a way of modeling game results, using data on team expenditures. The learner is 
taken through the process of modeling past results, and then using the model to forecast the 
outcome games not yet played. The course will show the learner how to evaluate the reliability 
of a model using data on betting odds. The analysis is applied first to the English Premier 
League, then the NBA and NHL. The course also provides an overview of the relationship between 
data analytics and gambling, its history and the social issues that arise in relation to sports 
betting, including the personal risks.

### Course 3
* **Introduction to Machine Learning in Sports Analytics**

The *Introduction to Machine Learning in Sports Analytics* course by **Christopher Brooks** explores supervised machine learning techniques 
using the python scikit learn (sklearn) toolkit and real-world athletic data to understand 
both machine learning algorithms and how to predict athletic outcomes. Building on the previous 
courses in the specialization, students will apply methods such as support vector machines 
(SVM), decision trees, random forest, linear and logistic regression, and ensembles of learners 
to examine data from professional sports leagues such as the NHL and MLB as well as 
wearable devices such as the Apple Watch and inertial measurement units (IMUs). By the end 
of the course students have a broad understanding of how classification and regression techniques 
can be used to enable sports analytics across athletic activities and events.

### Course 4
* **Foundations of Sports Analytics: Data, Representation, and Models in Sports**

The *Foundations of Sports Analytics: Data, Representation, and Models in Sports* course taught by **Wenche Wang** & **Stefan Szymanski** provides an 
introduction to using Python to analyze team performance in sports. Learners will discover a 
variety of techniques that can be used to represent sports data and how to extract narratives 
based on these analytical techniques. The main focus of the introduction will be on the use of 
regression analysis to analyze team and player performance data, using examples drawn from the 
National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey 
League (NHL), the English Premier League (EPL, soccer) and the Indian Premier League (IPL, cricket). 

This course does not simply explain methods and techniques, it enables the learner to apply them 
to sports datasets of interest so that they can generate their own results, rather than relying 
on the data processing performed by others.  As a consequence the learning will be empowered to 
explore their own ideas about sports team performance, test them out using the data, and so 
become a producer of sports analytics rather than a consumer.

While the course materials have been developed using Python, code has also been produced to 
derive all of the results in R, for those who prefer that environment.

### Course 5
* **Wearable Technologies and Sports Analytics**

The *Wearable Technologies and Sports Analytics* course taught by **Peter F. Bodary** is an introduction to wearable technology devices and their 
use in training and competition as part of the larger field of sport sciences. It includes 
an introduction to the physiological principles that are relevant to exercise training and 
sport performance and how wearable devices can be used to help characterize both training and 
performance. It includes access to some large sport team datasets and uses programming in 
python to explore concepts related to training, recovery and performance.
