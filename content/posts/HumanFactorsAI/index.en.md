## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of four weeks.

### Week 1
* **Design of AI Product Experiences**

Discussion of approaches and tools to perform human-centered design, which is critical to designing 
successful AI products. It walks through the key challenges involved in the user experience design 
of AI products and how to resolve them.

### Week 2
* **Data Privacy and AI**

Focuses on data privacy as it relates to AI products. Covers best practices in ensuring user 
privacy and the relevant U.S. and international privacy laws to be aware of. Discussion of how 
AI creates unique challenges in ensuring privacy and some of the methods and tools which can be 
employed to protect the privacy of user data.

### Week 3
* **Ethics in AI**

Discussion of the three main goals of ethical AI: fairness, accountability and transparency. 
Identifies common sources of bias in modeling projects and discuss approaches to detecting and 
mitigating bias, including organizational, process, and technical components.

### Week 4
* **Human and Societal Considerations**

Begins with differentiating between human intelligence and artificial intelligence, and then 
examines ways that they can compliment each other. The course concludes by learning about 
approaches to encourage adoption and inspire trust among users in your model.
