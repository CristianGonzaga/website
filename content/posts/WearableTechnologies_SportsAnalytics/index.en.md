## About the Course

The *Wearable Technologies and Sports Analytics* course offered by **University of Michigan** 
and taught by **Peter F. Bodary** is an introduction to wearable technology devices and their 
use in training and competition as part of the larger field of sport sciences. It includes 
an introduction to the physiological principles that are relevant to exercise training and 
sport performance and how wearable devices can be used to help characterize both training and 
performance. It includes access to some large sport team datasets and uses programming in 
python to explore concepts related to training, recovery and performance.

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of five weeks.

### Week 1
* **Introduction to Wearable Technology**

Introduction of different types of wearable devices that are used by athletes and teams to 
improve training and recovery. Starts by highlighting what types of sensors are used within 
the wearable devices and how the data coming from these sensors can provide insights, such 
as training intensity and or physiologic “readiness”.

### Week 2
* **External Loads of Wearable Technology**

Focuses on what we have introduced as “external” measures. Points out some of the 
(inaccurate) assumptions that are made regarding external measures of “load” and “effort”. 
In addition, outlines how the continuous use of wearable devices has led to new opportunities 
for quantifying effort as well as (in theory) reducing injury and improving performance. 
Finishes by describing the “acute to chronic workload” and the reasons it has gained a lot 
of attention in the past several years.

### Week 3
* **Internal Measures of Wearable Technology**

Dives more into the physiology of training and recovery, focusing on what we have introduced 
as “internal” measures. Exploration of the use of internal sensors to provide a glimpse of 
how the individual athlete is responding to the stress induced by training and/or competition. 
Highlights the pros and cons of using internal measures to evaluate individual and team training 
and recovery.

### Week 4
* **Combination of Internal and External Wearable Technology**

Combination of external and internal measures to provide a much more nuanced look at training 
and recovery. The external measures can provide a highly quantified evaluation of the movements 
and motions that have taken place, while the internal measures provide feedback about how the 
athlete is tolerating the training. Combining them can be instrumental for evaluating performance 
improvements and preventing or reducing overuse injuries.

### Week 5
* **Global Metrics**

Discussion of the exciting new global metrics that have been developed and/or used by many of 
the consumer devices that are available today. Although these new metrics are exciting, we want 
to be cognizant of the limitations of these devices. Therefore, discussion of what sensors are 
actually employed to provide these new metrics and highlight where validation is feasible.
