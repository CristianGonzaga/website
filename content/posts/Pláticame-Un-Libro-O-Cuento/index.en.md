## About

In Mexico, the habit of reading is not deeply rooted, especially with the technological 
development that increases this social problem. It was thought to motivate this practice by 
telling the reader's experience, not by reading a story or a book, but by talking about the 
reading and leaving the spectator curious to know more about the work. Thus, the YMCA 
Naucalpan Community Development Center's *Tell me a Book or Story* project seeks to develop 
children and young people's interest in reading by talking about a topic through a video 
that shares the reader's experience.

Among the activities carried out were the following:

1. Attend the informative meeting to learn about the project and the topic to be worked 
on, as well as to become aware of the social need.
2. Do research on the necessary technological issues.
3. Make informative videos about books or stories, which generate interest in the reader. 
4. Make weekly deliveries via Drive, receiving feedback from those in charge of the project.

Finally, the shared readings were:

* *The Cherry Orchard* by Antón Chéjov.
* La Nona" by Roberto Cossa.
* *Luvina* by Juan Rulfo.
* The Metamorphosis* by Franz Kafka.
* *La Plaza del Diamante* by Mercè Rodoreda.

Making the respective analysis of each book and including fragments that I considered 
attractive and interesting, in order to encourage them to be intrigued to read these works.
