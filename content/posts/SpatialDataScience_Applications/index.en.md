## About the Course

The *Spatial Data Science and Applications* course offered by **Yonsei University** 
and taught by **Joon Heo** starts with defining spatial data science and answering why 
spatial is special from three different perspectives - business, technology, and data in 
the first week.  In the second week, four disciplines related to spatial data 
science - GIS, DBMS, Data Analytics, and Big Data Systems, and the related open source 
software's - QGIS, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, R, and Hadoop tools are introduced together. 
During the third, fourth, and fifth weeks, you learn the four disciplines one by one 
from the principle to applications. In the final week, five real world problems and the 
corresponding solutions are presented with step-by-step procedures in environment of open 
source software's.

## Program

The learning contents were given during a period of six weeks.

### Week 1
* **Understanding Spatial Data Science**

This module is composed of four lectures. 

The first lecture "Introduction to spatial data science" 
was designed to give learners a solid concept of spatial data science in comparison with science, 
data science, and spatial data science. For Learner's better understanding, examples of spatial 
data science problems are also presented. 

The second, third, and fourth lectures focuses on "what 
is spatial special? - unique aspects of spatial data science from three perspectives of business, 
technology, and data, respectively. 

In the second lecture, learners will learn five reasons why 
major IT companies are serious about spatial data, in other words, maps. 

The third lecture will 
allow learners to understand four issues of dealing with spatial data, including DBMS problems, 
topology, spatial indexing, and spatial big data problems.

to understand another four issues of spatial data including spatial autocorrelation, map 
projection, uncertainty, and modifiable areal unit problem.

### Week 2
* **Solution Structures of Spatial Data Science Problems**

Four lectures will give learners an overview of academic subjects, software tools, and their 
combinations for the solution structures of spatial data science problems. 

The first lecture, 
"Four Disciplines for Spatial Data Science and Applications" introduces four academic disciplines 
related to spatial data science, which are Geographic Information System (GIS), Database Management 
System (DBMS), Data Analytics, and Big Data Systems. 

The second lecture "Open Source Software's" 
introduces open source software's in the four related disciplines, QGIS for GIS, PostgreSQL and 
PostGIS for DBMS, R for Data Analytics, Hadoop and Hadoop-based solutions for Big Data System, 
which are used throughout this course. 

The third lecture "Spatial Data Science Problems" 
presents six solution structures, which are different combinations of GIS, DBMS, Data Analytics, 
and Big Data Systems. The solution structures are related to the characteristics of given problems, 
which are the data size, the number of users, level of analysis, and main focus of problems. 

The fourth lecture "Spatial Data vs. Spatial Big Data" makes learner have a solid understanding 
of spatial data and spatial big data in terms of similarity and differences. Additionally, the 
value of spatial big data will be discussed.

### Week 3
* **Geographic Information System (GIS)**

The third module is "Geographic Information System (GIS)", which is one of the four disciplines for 
spatial data science. 

GIS has five layers, which are spatial reference framework, spatial data model, 
spatial data acquisition systems, spatial data analysis, and geo-visualization. This module is 
composed of six lecture. 

The first lecture "Five Layers of GIS" is an introduction to the third 
module. The rest of the lectures will cover the five layers of GIS, one by one. 

The second lecture 
"Spatial Reference Framework" will make learners understand, first, a series of formulation steps 
of physical earth, geoid, ellipsoid, datum, and map projections, second, coordinate transformation 
between different map projections. 

The third lecture "Spatial Data Models" will teach learners how 
to represent spatial reality in two spatial data models - vector model and raster model. 

The fourth 
lecture "Spatial Data Acquisition Systems" will cover topics on how and where to acquire spatial 
data and how to produce your own spatial data. 

The fifth lecture "Spatial Data Analysis", will make 
learners to have brief taste of how to extract useful and valuable information from spatial data. 
More advanced algorithms for spatial analysis will be covered in the fifth module. 

In the sixth 
lecture "Geovisualization and Information Delivery", learners will understand powerful aspects as 
well as negative potentials of cartographic representations as a communication media of spatial 
phenomenon.

### Week 4
* **Spatial DBMS and Big Data Systems**

The fourth module covers two disciplines related to spatial data science, and will make learners 
understand how to use DBMS and Big Data Systems to manage spatial data and spatial big data. 
This module is composed of six lectures. 

The first two lectures will cover DBMS and Spatial DBMS, 
and the rest of the lectures will cover Big Data Systems. 

The first lecture "Database Management 
System (DBMS)" will introduce powerful functionalities of DBMS and related features, and limitations 
of conventional Relational DBMS for spatial data. 

The second lecture "Spatial DBMS" focuses on the 
difference of spatial DBMS from conventional DBMS, and new features to manage spatial data. 

The third lecture will give learners a brief overview of Big Data Systems and the current paradigm - 
MapReduce. 

The fourth lecture will cover Hadoop MapReduce, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), 
Hadoop YARN, as an implementation of MapReduce paradigm, and also will present the first example of 
spatial big data processing using Hadoop MapReduce. 

The fifth lecture will introduce Hadoop ecosystem 
and show how to utilize Hadoop tools such as Hive, Pig, Sqoop, and HBase for spatial big data 
processing. 

The last lecture "Spatial Big Data System" will introduce two Hadoop tools for spatial 
big data - Spatial Hadoop and GIS Tools for Hadoop, and review their pros and cons for spatial big 
data management and processing.

### Week 5
* **Spatial Data Analytics**

The fifth module is entitled to "Spatial Data Analytics", which is one of the four disciplines 
related to spatial data science. 

Spatial Data Analytics could cover a wide spectrum of spatial 
analysis methods, however, in this module, only some portion of spatial data analysis methods 
will be covered. 

The first lecture is an introduction, in which an overview of Spatial Data 
Analytics and a list of six topics are given and discussed. 

The second lecture "Proximity and 
Accessibility" will make learners realize how spatial data science can be used for business 
applications, while trade area analysis, supply to demand ratio, Floating Catchment Analysis (FCA), 
and Gravity-based index of accessibility are introduced and applied to real world problems. 

The 
third lecture "Spatial Autocorrelation" will give an instruction on how to measure spatial 
autocorrelation and to apply hypothesis test with Moran's I. 

The fourth lecture "Spatial 
Interpolation" will introduce trend surface analysis, inverse distance weighting, and Kriging. 
Particularly, in-depth explanations regarding Kriging, a de facto standard of spatial interpolation 
will be presented. 

The fifth lecture "Spatial Categorization" will make learners understand 
classification algorithms such as Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) and Decision Tree (DT), clustering 
algorithms such as K-Means and DBSCAN with real-world examples. 

The sixth lecture "Hotspot Analysis" 
will introduce hotspot analysis and Getis-Ord GI* as the most popular method. The seventh lecture 
"Network Analysis" will make learners explore the algorithms of geocoding, map matching, and 
shortest path finding, of which importance is increasing in spatial big data analysis.

### Week 6
* **Practical Applications of Spatial Data Science**

The sixth module is entitled to "Practical Applications of Spatial Data Science", in which five 
real-world problems are introduced and corresponding solutions are presented with step-by-step 
procedures in the solution structures and related open source software's, discussed in Module 2. 

The first lecture presents an example of Desktop GIS, in which only QGIS is used, to find the top 
5 counties for timberland investment in the southeastern states of the U.S, in which simple 
differencing of demand and supply is applied to figure out counties of large deficit of timber 
supply in comparison with timber demand. 

In the second lecture, an example of sever GIS, in which 
QGIS and PostgreSQL/PostGIS are used, will be presented as a solution for a given problem of NYC 
spatial data center, which required multiple user access and different levels of privileges. 

The third lecture presents an example of spatial data analytics, in which QGIS and R are used, to find 
out any regional factors which contribute to higher or lower disease prevalence in administrative 
districts, for which spatial autocorrelation analysis is conducted and decision tree analysis is 
applied. 

The fourth lecture is another example of spatial data analytics, to find optimal 
infiltration routing with network analysis, in which cost surface is produced and Dijkstra's 
algorithm is used. 

The fifth lecture is an example of spatial big data management and analytics, 
in which QGIS, PostGIS, R, and Hadoop MapReduce are all used, to provide a solution of "Passenger 
Finder", which can guide to the places where more passengers are waiting for taxi cabs. For the 
solution, spatial big data, taxi trajectory, are collected, and noise removal and map matching are 
conducted in Hadoop environment. Then, a series of spatial data processing and analysis such as 
spatial join in PostGIS, hotspot analysis in R are conducted in order to provide the solution. All 
in all, learners will realize the value of spatial big data and power of the solution structure 
with combination of four disciplines.
