## Program

The specialized program consists of a set of three courses.

### Course 1
* **Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers**

The *Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers* course builds a foundational understanding of what machine learning 
is, how it works and when and why it is applied. This course provides a non-coding introduction to 
machine learning, with focus on the process of developing models, ML model evaluation and 
interpretation, and the intuition behind common ML and deep learning algorithms. 
The course concludes with a hands-on project in which you train and optimize a machine learning 
model on a simple real-world problem.

### Course 2
* **Managing Machine Learning Projects**

The course *Managing Machine Learning Projects* provides ecourse on the key steps of an ML project, 
from how to identify good opportunities for ML to data collection, model creation, 
deployment, and monitoring and maintenance of production systems.

In addition, it focuses on developing the corresponding skills to: 
1. Identify opportunities to apply ML to solve problems for users
2. Apply the data science process to organize ML projects
3. Evaluate the key technology decisions to make in ML system design
4. Lead ML projects from ideation through production using best practice

### Course 3
* **Human Factors in AI**

The *Human Factors in AI* course focuses on the critical human factors in developing AI-based 
products.  The course begins with an introduction to human-centered design and the unique elements 
of user experience design for AI products.  Participants will then learn about the role of data 
privacy in AI systems, the challenges of designing ethical AI, and approaches to identify sources 
of bias and mitigate fairness issues.  The course concludes with a comparison of human intelligence 
and artificial intelligence, and a discussion of the ways that AI can be used to both automate as 
well as assist human decision-making.
