# About me


Nice to meet you! My name is Cristian Gonzaga LÃ³pez, a fifth semester student of Data Science 
and Mathematics Engineering. I like to learn and I seek to be better every day.

## Profile

There are different sets of skills and tools that have allowed me to perform well in 
different fields of my life. I believe that I have several strengths that will be very 
important in the near and distant future, and although there are some aspects in which 
I still have areas for improvement, I do not consider them to be dangerous, but rather 
I see them as opportunities to continue growing as a person. Among my competencies stand out:

* **Risk-taker**. I show resourcefulness and resilience in facing and challenging 
situations.
* **Communicator**. I express confidently and creatively to collaborate effectively 
with other individuals and groups.
* **Balanced**. I maintain my overall well-being through physical, mental, social 
and emotional balance.
* **Inquirer**. I nurture my curiosity through learning and research, as appropriate. 
* **Principled**. I act with honesty and fairness, having respect for the dignity and 
rights of others. Furthermore, I take responsibility for my actions and their consequences.
* **Leadership**. I propose initiatives and alternatives to explore new ideas and 
innovative strategies. 
* **Critical thinking**. I analyze and evaluate the events and problems around me in order 
to be able to act by making reasoned and ethical decisions.
* **Reflective**. I thoughtfully evaluate my ideas and experiences to understand my strengths 
and weaknesses to contribute to my learning and personal development.
* **Responsible**. I fulfill my obligations in a committed and disciplined manner.
* **Caring**. I show empathy, sensitivity and respect for others, helping and acting to the 
best of my ability.
* **Team work**. I work collaboratively to have different perspectives and diversity of 
ideas to get a better result.


## Programming Languages and Software Management.
I have experience and proficiency in the languages of **Java** (High Intermediate), 
**R** (High Intermediate), **Python** (Advanced), **C++** (Intermediate), **SQL** 
(Intermediate) and **SAS** (Beginner). In addition, I have diverse knowledge of the 
Office package, especially **Excel**, **Word** and **PowerPoint**. I also use several 
computational tools: **Anaconda, MatLab, Minitab, MySQL, NetBeans, PyCharm, Mathematica, 
RStudio** and **GAMS**.


## Achievements and awards.

##### 1st place in SAS Institute "Safe Roads" Competition.

Analysis of vehicle collisions in Toronto, Canada. Development of *Machine Learning* 
algorithms to classify public places according to the risk of an accident occurring 
near them, as well as an algorithm that calculates the probability of a collision 
from weather conditions.

##### 1st place in the Adventurer category of the 10K Challenge 2021.

Analysis of the coverage of medical units (hospitalization units, outpatient units 
and support facilities) in the State of Mexico, in order to study the access of the 
mexiquenses to these services and, consequently, propose improvement actions to 
provide health services to all mexiquenses. *Python* and *R* were used for the 
analysis, modeling and simulation, together with a *web scrapping* to collect 
the geographic location of each public medical unit in the State of Mexico. 

##### Honorable Mention in the XXX National Physics Olympiad of the SMF.

The XXX National Physics Olympiad was held in Villahermosa, Tabasco from November 
17 to 21, 2019. Participated 126 students from 31 states of the country. In that 
competition I obtained honorable mention given my results in the theoretical and 
experimental exam. Thanks to the above, the team won first place in the Adventurer 
category of the 10K Challenge 2021 organized by the Data Science Hub.

##### 1st place in the XXX Physics Olympiad in the State of Mexico.

The award ceremony of the XXX took place in the Auditorium of the Library Area "El 
Cerillo" (next to the Faculty of Science - UAEM) on July 8, 2019. In the state medal 
of this competition I obtained the first place.
