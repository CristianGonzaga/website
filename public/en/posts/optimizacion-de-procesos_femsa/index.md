# Process Optimization. FEMSA Coca-Cola

It was analyzed Femsa-Coca Cola data production at the Altamira plant from 6/07/2021 
to 30/07/21. The data was delivered by KOF in .csv format (the first version) and 
in Excel format (the second version created with the data transposed and without missing data).
The objective of the analysis was to develop a model that explains the relationship 
between the energy needed for the production chain and different variables in order 
to minimize energy use. 

The work was divided into three steps. First, an exploratory analysis was carried out in
order to understand the data and learn the database structure. This analysis was 
decided to be done in a shiny dashboard in R, so that the information can be 
accessible through the web application generated by the code.

Then, an analysis was taken out of the energy and power variables by SKU. 
A 2-tailed hypothesis test was performed to identify if more bottles are 
produced for a certain SKU in each compressor.

Lastly, a Random Forest algorithm was taken out to predict the electrical power of 
each compressor on each line and with the lines together. In addition, the importance of 
each variable (in its use for this algorithm) was calculated. Obtaining a  Random Forest 
algorithm with 100 trees that can describe, to a large extent, the electrical 
power of the compressors.
