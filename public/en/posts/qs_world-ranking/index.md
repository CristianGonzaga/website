## About

University rankings are lists that evaluate universities around the world 
based on different metrics. For prospective students, university rankings may seem like a 
simple way to assess the quality of an institution, shortlist options and make decisions.
While for universities, rankings can be a planning tool, which allows them to define 
strategies and objectives to improve their reputation and therefore student attraction.

The QS University Rankings is an annual publication that aims to be a decision-making 
tool for both universities and students. Methodologically, it groups its measurement 
indicators into four main areas: academic indicators, employment indicators, student 
indicators and finally. internationality indicators.

The project explores the variables that are part of the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) University 
Ranking (such as academic reputation, citation score, employers and international students 
reputation, among others), the weight that they have in positioning a university, the 
changes over time in the ranking and fastest-growing universities, the status of each 
university's faculty and possible strategies to improve scores. It is analyzed the 
position of various universities from 2011 to 2021 and emphasis is placed 
on the position and score of the institution analyzed in the ranking, in order 
to provide recommendations to that institution.
