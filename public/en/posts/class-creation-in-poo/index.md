# Class Creation in Object Oriented Python

<!--more-->

## About the Course.

It is important to note that Object Oriented languages allow the developer to 
think in terms of real-world objects (people, cars, and animals, for example).
In addition, allows to think in terms of functions (or procedures) and 
the data those functions act on. This can lead to programs that are easier to 
understand, maintain, and reuse.

Once the above has been clarified, *Class Creation in Object Oriented Python* 
course addresses how to create a constructor for the class, create object 
instances of the class, and sort a list of objects created from a file.
