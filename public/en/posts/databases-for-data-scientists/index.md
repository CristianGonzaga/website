# Databases for Data Scientists

<!--more-->

## About the Course
The *Databases for Data Scientists* course, offered by **University of Colorado Boulder** 
and taught by **Alan Paradise**, teaches about database design, database software 
fundamentals, and how to use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to work with 
databases. Concludes with an overview of future trends in databases, including 
non-relational databases (NoSQL) and Big Data. Therefore, upon completion of this
specialization, one is ready to design and create efficient and effective relational 
databases, fill them with data, and work with them using SQL.

## Program

The specialized program consists of a set of three courses.

### Course 1
* **Relational Database Design**

The *Relational Database Design* course, offered by **University of Colorado Boulder** 
and taught by **Di Wu**, provides a step-by-step guidance to start from a raw idea to 
an implementable relational database.

### Course 2
* **The Structured Query Language (SQL)**

The *The Structured Query Language (SQL)* course, offered by **University of Colorado Boulder** 
and taught by **Alan Paradise**, reviews the origins of the language and its 
conceptual foundations. But primarily, focus on learning all the standard SQL 
commands, their syntax, and how to use these commands to conduct analysis of the 
data within a relational database. Finally, includes the DDL ("Data Definition 
Language") and DML ("Data Manipulation Language") commands necessary to create 
and maintain database objects.

### Course 3
* **Advanced Topics and Future Trends in Database Technologies**

The *Advanced Topics and Future Trends in Database Technologies* course, 
offered by **University of Colorado Boulder** and taught by **Di Wu** and **Alan Paradise**, 
teaches some of the more in-depth and advanced areas of database technologies, followed 
by a look at the future of database software and where the industry is heading.
