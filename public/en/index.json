From these locations, the ones that were duplicated were removed. Then, to obtain the coordinates of each location, web scraping techniques were used; with the support of the Selenium library a bot was programmed in the Python programming language that searched for the addresses of each location in Google Maps, and saved the coordinates of each of those points in the database. To plot the coordinates on the map a WGS 84 projection was used, in order to adjust the position of the points on the corresponding map. This was done with the Folium library. Once these data with the locations were obtained, only 300 were randomly selected, taking care that these data were properly scraped, in other words: correctly extracted. Some addresses were not properly located because some of the address names were incomplete, so they were not a real place or a real location. Therefore, manually, data that did not completely match their corresponding address were searched for. Once these 300 random locations were obtained, they were plotted using the Python library “Folium”, which plotted these points on an interactive map. This map shows the locations of each delivery point, the location of the Azcapotzalco CEDIS, and the municipalities to which this CEDIS delivers. In order to obtain several delivery routes and not only 1 vehicle passing through all the points, it was decided to group these points by zones. For this, the K-means unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm was used to find these clusters. In order to use implement the Multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (MVRP), the cost of the trips between each point must be known, therefore, the API “OSMR” (Open Source Routing Machine) was used, which calculates the time that a vehicle would take between 2 given points. This makes it possible to obtain the variables necessary to use the traveling agent algorithm. Finally, the Python algorithm was used in order to trace the optimal route given by the CVRP. Thus, in general, the solution to this problem took into account the 300 points to be visited, the delivery times for each item (the distances between each pair of points were also considered), the number of vehicles to meet the demand, and the capacity of these vehicles.

Additionally, a local web application was generated in which the user can choose both the station and the time period to be visualized, using the shiny and shinydashboard libraries.

The code of the analyzed dataset GSE44076 was retrieved from the Geo DataSets database, which refers to different types of mucosa in the colon, in which some adenocarcinoma and tumor cells were detected. From these data, a classification of subjects with healthy colon mucosa and with cancerous tumors was made according to their age: 50 to 60 years old (adults) and 70 to 85 years old (elders). In the case of the search for differentially expressed genes, distinct considerations (age, sex, nationality, among others) were made for the creation of the groups. Also, it was determined the number of samples to be used for each group, the number of genes to be analyzed, the magnitude of change (log base change) and the statistical significance (p-value) to calculate their significant influence on the results. After statistical processing in R Studio, using the limma and GEOquery packages and the algorithm implemented to find the most significant p-values and effect sizes, 10 differentially expressed genes were obtained from the ratio classification between healthy adults and those in a pathological state, which are: CRNDE, MMP7, MEPB1B, CA7, among others. Once the genes were obtained, various bioinformatics resources were used to make sense of the genes. This step allowed to validate the information and provide a livelihood, identifying the functionalities of these genes, their relationship to biological processes, their type of molecules, among others. Thus, a better analysis and understanding of the impact of genes was achieved. Finally, once it has been proven that the selected genes have a close relationship with the object of study, it is appropriate to consider these genes as important in the pathological processes, so that solutions and strategies can be developed based on them. Thus, by identifying a gene that is specifically present in adults in a certain age range with colon cancer, it is possible to understand its threat (to a certain extent), or to treat it if it lends itself to it. Therefore, different alternatives to colonoscopy can be developed, such as the implementation of low-cost microchips to analyze the biomarkers that cause colon cancer.
